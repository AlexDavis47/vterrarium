Marine biologists have spent decades attempting to document this cryptic species, but specimens seem to vanish during observation or transform into entirely different fish. Its shifting colors, unpredictable behaviors, and apparent ability to ignore the laws of physics have led some to theorize it may not be a true fish at all, but rather a manifestation of the ocean's collective unconscious. Those lucky enough to glimpse one report feelings of profound wonder and mild existential confusion."
