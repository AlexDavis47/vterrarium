Native to warm tropical waters, this species spends most of its day drifting with currents rather than swimming with purpose. Marine biologists note that the red fish has evolved to conserve energy by doing the bare minimum required for survival, making it an excellent pet for beginners. Despite its apparent laziness, it's surprisingly resilient and can adapt to a wide range of aquarium conditions."
