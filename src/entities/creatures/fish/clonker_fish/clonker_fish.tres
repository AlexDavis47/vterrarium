Its metallic body and mechanical movements might seem intimidating at first, but this gentle giant is surprisingly friendly and sociable. Despite its advanced engineering, it has a tendency to experience 'technical difficulties' with its digestive system, often resulting in comical situations. Its creators are still working on fixing these 'bugs' in its design."
