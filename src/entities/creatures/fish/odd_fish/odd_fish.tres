However, its beautiful exterior hides a rather antisocial personality. Its lifeless, beady eyes and expressionless face give it an unsettling appearance, and it seems to have no interest in interacting with its tankmates. It prefers to swim alone in the corners of the tank, occasionally casting judgmental glances at the other fish's social activities."
