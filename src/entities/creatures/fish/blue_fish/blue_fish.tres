Native to the clear waters of coral reefs, these social creatures travel in small schools that perform synchronized swimming patterns to confuse predators. Their diet consists primarily of small crustaceans and algae, which they hunt with remarkable efficiency. Blue fish are particularly sensitive to water quality but reward careful aquarists with their vibrant colors and active swimming behaviors."
